#### Info about me...
Hello! I am a first year M.S. Student at the Language & Knowledge Lab at KAIST, advised by Minjoon Seo.<br>
I am also a research intern at the Language Team at Naver AI Lab, advised by Jamin Shin.<br>
<br>
My main research goal is to understand the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs) and to enhance their capabilities for more effective deployment in real-world scnearios.
<br>
I am actively looking for a PhD position at the US (admission for Fall 2024)!<br>
