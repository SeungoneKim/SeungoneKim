#### Info about me...
Hello! I am a first year M.S. Student at the Language & Knowledge Lab at KAIST, advised by Minjoon Seo.<br> 
Formerly, I was an undergraudate student at Yonsei University. <br>
<br>
My main research goal is to build neural models that have practical value when deployed for real-world use cases. <br>
Specifically, I am interested in,<br> 
(1) grounding neural models to share commonsense knowledge as humans do, <br>
(2) enabling neural models to understand and truly follow human instructions, <br> 
(3) enforcing neural models to generate helpful & factual responses, and refusing to answer to toxic inputs. <br>
<br>
In addition, I also enjoy thinking of neural architectures that might have good inductive biases than Transformers. <br>
<br>
Reach out to me via email (louisdebroglie@kaist.ac.kr) if you have any questions, or would like to cooperate with me!
