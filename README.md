#### Info about me...
Hello! I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University and a M.S. Student at KAIST, advised by Minjoon Seo.<br>
<br>
My primary research focus lies establishing a science of language model behaviors.<br> Concretely, my research interests include: (i) developing LLM evaluation frameworks that systematically identify what specific capabilities language models lack and (ii) improving language models with (human) feedback.<br>
<br>
Reach out to me via email (seungone@cmu.edu) if you have any questions, or would like to collaborate with me!<br>
